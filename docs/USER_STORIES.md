# USER STORIES

## Customisable forms: 
A user should be able to customise their data. 
E.g. to be able to customise what fields and data types go in their treatment records. This customisability is actually a big appeal for these clinic apps, especially for private practitioners, who need to be able to customise what they include in their treatments and records. It's really not a 'one size fits all' situation.
