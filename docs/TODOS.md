# TODOS / NOTES

TODO: 

- New table for categories- user is able to make new ones, so they should be stored in the db, AND they should connected to the appointments> appointment_type field

- Change category to appointment type on the front end (this is what the database is calling it)

- Think of where to deploy database - Railway??? 

- Make index tables. 

RESEARCH: 

How the heck do we test a postgres database??? Is it in memory? lolll 

STACK / TECH DECISIONS: 

- NO REACT ROUTER -FUCK THAT
- YES to Electron babyyyy

NOTICINGS: 

There could be a need to have the clients table notes field be it's own table too. For instacne if the user wants to add more notes to the main client info page as they go, not treatment notes, this new table would give the possibility to date any additional notes.
