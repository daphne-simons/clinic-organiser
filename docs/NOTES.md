- Noticings: 

There could be a need to have the clients table notes field be it's own table too. For instacne if the user wants to add more notes to the main client info page as they go, not treatment notes, this new table would give the possibility to date any additional notes. 

! TODO: Change category to appointment type on the front end (this is what the database is calling it)

QUESTION: 

How the heck do we test a postgres database??? Is it in memory? lolll
