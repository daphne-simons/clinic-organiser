Prototype for an acupuncture clinic management system with scheduling, client records, treatment notes, and body chart annotations. 

Built with a PWA focus.

Frontend:
React + TypeScript (your sweet spot)
Tailwind CSS for rapid UI development
React Router for navigation - ??? 
React Query (TanStack Query) for data fetching/caching
Fabric.js or Konva.js for body chart drawing functionality
React Hook Form for form management

Backend:
Node.js + Express (familiar territory)
PostgreSQL instead of SQLite (better for concurrent access, file handling)
Prisma ORM (more modern than Knex, great TypeScript support)
Multer for file uploads
Sharp for image processing/optimization

PWA Enhancement:
Workbox for service worker management
IndexedDB for offline data caching
Web App Manifest for installable experience

File Storage:
AWS S3 or Cloudinary for images/documents (body charts, x-rays, reports)
